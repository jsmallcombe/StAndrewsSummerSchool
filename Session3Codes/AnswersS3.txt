exp([0]+[1]*log(x)+[2]*pow(log(x),2))
A) Should turn over and head to zero at zero do to absorbtion and no signal size.
10375 +- 102 counts at 1332
B) 0.577 %
C) 1.2%
D) ~1.7 %
E) Kinematic broading due to detector opening angle and doppler shit due relative position.
gBeta=0.0577059;
F) 511 keV produced in positron annihilation, which only occurs at ~rest so there is no kinematic shift.
G) They are self coincident
H) True coincidence peak, width due to detector resolution and large false coincidence background due to high rate.
