A)224823 (226176 is the number of hits)
B)Should look like 60Co spectrum
C)59000 +- 4000
D)0 - 3.3298E+11
E) ~1.2 % at 1200 keV
F1)Because resolution is proptional to sqrt number of charge carriers, % worse at low energy
F2)Because only a 2 point calibration was used, so the alighment of the 3 channles is poor away from the calibration points. 
F3)Signal to noise ratio smaller in electronics
